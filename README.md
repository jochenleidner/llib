## README.md - LLib: A Lightweight and Free Rust Software Library ##

LLib™ is a library of convenience functions, useful interfaces
algorithms and data structures created by Jochen L. Leidner in the
course of his exploration of the Rust programming language.

LLib™ also supports the implementation of LTools™, a set of useful
command-line utilities implemented in Rust, also initiated by the
same author.
